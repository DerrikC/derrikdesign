## Overview

The client needed a custom brand identity to stand out from his competitors, and also wanted an established social media presence to obtain more leads for his Real Estate practice.

## Social Media

I lead the direction of the social media marketing and designs. I created a styleguide and theme to structure the newly created brand identity, and also created the supporting custom assets.

## Bench Advertisement

I designed a custom bench advertisement that follows the styleguide I created, while also meeting the standards of the sign printers and Royal Lepage's branding guidelines.
