## Overview

In my spare time I create digital paintings. I am constantly learning new techniques and trying to apply my illustrations to practical design. 

## Posters

I created Netflix title poster for a concept Ice Cube documentary.

This is a poster for the comedian Joe Rogan's comedy special 'Strange Times'.

## Concept Art

Currently I've been fascinated with space and so I have been exploring alien character designs.
