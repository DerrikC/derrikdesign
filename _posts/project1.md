## Overview

CyberSafe is a concept cyber security startup that offers digital protection solutions for businesses. I designed the brand identity through the use of a logo design, vector illustrations and custom icons.

## Custom Icons

The cyber security icons were created using illustrator, and were made to be used throughout the product design.

## Custom Vector Art

Rough ideas were sketched out for the hook image accent. The solution achieved was a modern isometric illustration.
